This repository contains some projects I made in my learning period.

# TeleportCommand
This plugin has one config file.
When you execute the command /teleportloc it will teleport you to the location specified in the config.yml and shows the message that's also specified in the config.yml
That's simply all what it does.

# GameModeCommand
Woo, a gamemodecommand plugin!
Simple, yet effective.
It has one main command, that's /gamemodes.
It supports 4 gamemodes on this moment, creative, survival, spectator and adventure.

Example usage: /gamemodes creative.
As always, everything is customizable and changeable, feel free to take a look at the src!

Permissions: gamemodes.use to use the /gamemodes commands.

Do you want something to be added?
Say it!
