This repository contains some projects I made in my learning period.

# TeleportCommand
This plugin has 2 files, messages.yml and config.yml.
When you execute the command /teleportloc it will teleport you to the location specified in the config.yml and show the message from the messages.yml.
That's simply all what it does.
